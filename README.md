Introduction
============

This package provides a solver for a system of linear equations. It is an
implementation of the [tridiagonal matrix algorithm][1], also known as *Thomas
algorithm*.

System, by example of `n = 4` unknowns `x`:

    b[0] * x[0] + c[0] * x[1]                             = d[0]
    a[0] * x[0] + b[1] * x[1] + c[1] * x[2]               = d[1]
                  a[1] * x[1] + b[2] * x[2] + c[2] * x[3] = d[2]
                                a[2] * x[2] + b[3] * x[3] = d[3]

In matrix notation:

The algorithm is only guaranteed to find a solution if the tridiagonal matrix
is *diagonally dominant:*

    |b[0]|   > |c[0]|
    |b[1]|   > |a[0]| + |c[1]|
    |b[2]|   > |a[1]| + |c[2]|
    …
    |b[n-1]| > |a[n-2]|

In other words: If that condition is *not* met, then it may happen that the
algorithm cannot find a solution even if one exists.

In case no solution is found, the result is `null`. For bad input, the result
is undefined.


Examples
========

  * Three unknowns:

    ![Rendering in matrix notation][3]

    Input:

        var solve = require('tridiagonal-solve');
        return solve([4, 3], [9, -7, 8], [1, 2], [5, 6, 2]);

    Result: `[0.6, -0.4, 0.4]`

  * Matrix is *not* diagonally dominant, and algorithm fails although solution
    exists:

    ![Rendering in matrix notation][4]

    Snippet: `solve([0], [1, 0], [1], [1, 0])`

    Result: `null`

  * Solution found although matrix is *not* diagonally dominant:

    ![Rendering in matrix notation][5]

    Snippet: `solve([1], [1, 0], [1], [1, 0])`

    Result: `[0, 1]`


Coding conventions
==================

  * Code needs to validate with JSLint.

  * Comments are in Markdown.

  * Avoid constructors (JS is classless), don’t throw exceptions (not necessary
    in JS).

  * Versioning: major.minor.bug-fix

    Incompatible changes to the API mandate an update of the major version.

    Keep version up to date in:

      + Git tags

      + `package.json`
